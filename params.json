{"name":"Cardboarddemo","tagline":"An iOS Stereoscopic viewer for testing Googe Cardboard","body":"CardboardDemo\r\n==================\r\n\r\n## Overview ##\r\n\r\nThis is a simple app that demonstrates rendering a 3D scene on an iOS device so that it can be viewed on a stereoscopic viewer such as Google Cardboard.\r\n\r\nIt has very basic head tracking (no movement yet).\r\n\r\n\r\n## License ##\r\n\r\nBSD-style, with the full license available in LICENCE.\r\n\r\n## Usage ##\r\n\r\nDownload the project and run through Xcode on a device. It will run on the Simulator but the performance will be less than optimal, plus head-tracking\r\nwill not work.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgments ##\r\n\r\nA big thanks for the following:\r\n\r\nThe perspective projection shader and texture rendering code was based on Brad Lawson's OculusRiftSceneKit demo (https://github.com/BradLarson/OculusRiftSceneKit)\r\n\r\nThe GLProgram wrapper was taken from Jeff LaMarche's Simple OpenGLES 2.0 Example (https://github.com/jlamarche/iOS-OpenGLES-Stuff)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
